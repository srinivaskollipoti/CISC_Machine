Foreword, By Dongju Yun.
Until the day of death, looking up to the sky, hope there isn't a dot of shame.
I have been tormented even by the wind rising between the leaves.
With a heart sings of a star I shall love all things dying.
And I shall walk the road given to me.
Tonight, again, the star is grazed by the wind.
